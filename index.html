<h1>About Me</h1>
<h3>Gym Trainer</h3>
<p>My name is Raja Iftakar. I decided to become a personal trainer having spent years being that person who wanted desperately to lose weight and feel good about themselves. I've been on every diet under the sun, and my weight fluctuated massively. Now, having emerged the other side and achieved my goals, I want to use my skills, my experience and my own journey to help others.
</p>
<p> I care about my clients, and there's nothing more important to me than helping somebody go through an experience that makes them happy, confident and strong. I know how being overweight affects your whole life, and I want to be there for those who want to bring about change.I want to help you discover the benefits of training that have helped me became the person Iam today, and I'm here to guide you every step of the way.
